= Query by specification
* https://github.com/jeroenvs/querybyspec

== DESCRIPTION

Enables users to query the data storage by specification:
Repository<Person> persons = new PersonRepository();
Specification<Person> isGoldMember = spendsAtleast(500).and(memberSince(2005));
List<Person> goldMembers = persons.matching(isGoldMember);

== FEATURES    

- Specification library
Provides a wide variety of default specifications, based on the type-safe specification
interface, as described by Martin Fowler. These specifications, for one, include:
 * equality
 * compare (gt,lt)
 * composition (and,or,not)
 
not(and(or(x,y),z)).isSatisfiedBy(candidate);
 
In addition we provide a utility class for specifications, which allows specifications
to be used for the selection and counting on iterable objects. 

Specifications.findAllSatisfying(isGoldMember, members);
Specifications.countAllSatisfying(isGoldMember, members);
Specifications.isSatisfiedByAll(isGoldMember, members);
Specifications.isSatisfiedBySome(isGoldMember, members);

- Repository library
Repositories can be used to find entities, matching a certain specification.
This allows us to do the following:

Repository<Person> persons;
List<Person> matches = persons.matching(spec);

By default our library provides two repository strategies:

* In memory strategy
new InMemoryRepositoryStrategy<Person>(collection).matching(spec);
* Java persistence strategy
new JpaRepositoryStrategy<Person>(Person.class).matching(spec);
